# Python Data Coding Challenge

Use polars to wrangle the data and a visualization package like Plotly or lets-plot to create a unique chart for two of the four questions below.  

Here is the [United States birth names data](https://github.com/byuidatascience/data4names/raw/master/data-raw/names_year/names_year.csv) for the challenge.

## Background

Early in prehistory, some descriptive names began to be used repeatedly until they formed a name pool for a particular culture. Parents would choose names from the pool of existing names rather than invent new ones for their children.

With the rise of Christianity, specific trends in naming practices manifested. Christians were encouraged to name their children after saints and martyrs of the church. These early Christian names are in various forms in many cultures today. Early missionaries spread them throughout the Mediterranean basin and Europe.

By the Middle Ages, the Christian influence on naming practices was pervasive. Each culture had its pool of names, a combination of native and early Christian names that had been in the language long enough to be considered native.

### Challenge questions

- [ ] How does your name or a family member's name in the data compare to its use before 1985?
- [ ] If you talked to someone named Brittany on the phone, what is your guess of their age? What ages would you not guess?
- [ ] Mary, Martha, Peter, and Paul are all Christian names. Compare the usage of each of the four names from 1920 to 2000.
- [ ] Think of a unique name from a famous movie. Plot that name and see how the increases coincide with the movie's release.
